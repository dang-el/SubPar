## Introduction

### Purpose:
The purpose of this document is to illustrate the Funtional and Non-Functional Requirements of SubPar, an IOS Application designed soley to help a Golfer improve at his or her game as well as taking the work of keeping score and storing scorecards off of the Golfer's hands, as well as much more, so that they only need to worry about holding the club.

Some of the key goals of this Application are:

- Assist Golfers with the simple "not fun" parts of golf like remembering, keeping, and calculating score, so that the Golfer only needs to worry about not hitting the trees and going in the drink (we wish we could help you with your slice).

- Manage various Golfers account, keeping log-in information secure as well seamless transitons between Golfers allowing multiple registered Golfer's individual games to be tracked from a single device.

- Assist Golfers with tips for which club to use based on how they have shot in the past.

- Allow Golfer to reflect back on proir games as well as track improvement.
